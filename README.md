# IPND project selection

This repository holds my main project work from Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.

* A basic web page created in the initial stages of learning HTML and CSS. Open `index.html` in your browser.
* A fill-in-the-blanks game in Python. To run the game, `cd` into the projects directory and execute `python fill_in_the_blanks.py`
* A small SQL project using Python. It doesn't include the virtual machine on which to run it, but the code is easy to follow.

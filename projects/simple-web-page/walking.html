                The hills offer a great range of walking terrain, from quiet treks exploring the lower wooded slopes to exhilarating stomps along high ridge paths.

                Aside from the natural beauty of the countryside, there are many interesting man-made features such as the ancient hill fort that tops the hill known as British Camp; an disused gold mine, and some abandoned workings from when the hills were quarried for their appealing stone.

            <h3>Far-reaching views</h3>
            <p>
                The backbone of the hills runs roughly north to south along the boundaries of the English counties of Worcestershire and Herefordshire, and there are fine views across the flat Severn Plain to the east, and the rolling countryside to the west. On a clear day, from the highest point on the hills, the Worcestershire Beacon, you can see all the way across Herefordshire to Wales.

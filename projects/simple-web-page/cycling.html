	        	Many people love to moutain bike in The Malverns, as it's possible to use the many miles of bridleways for the sport. But the area is also beloved of road bikers, who enjoy the combination of flatter Worcestershire lanes, the huge climbs into the hills themselves and the undulating Herefordshire countryside to the west.

	        <h3>Wonderful on wheels</h3>
	        
	        <p>
	        	My passion is road biking in the area. Pedalling around that network of quiet country roads in Herefordshire, to the west of the hills, is a lovely way to spend a sunny Sunday afternoon. The rolling  hills drop in and out of sight, and the familiar slopes are a great landmark if you lose your way!<br>

	        <h3>Gearing up</h3>

	        <p>	
	        	Organised cycling events known as Sportives take place in the region every year, and training to be able to undertake the distances involved - often 60 miles or more - is an exciting challenge.

	           The Malvern Mad Hatter is one such yearly event.
